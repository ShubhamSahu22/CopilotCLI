AWS Copilot CLI

Documentation: https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/
The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release and operate production-ready containerized applications on AWS App Runner or Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate.

Use Copilot to:

Deploy production-ready, scalable services on AWS from a Dockerfile in one command.
Add databases or inject secrets to your services.
Grow from one microservice to a collection of related microservices in an application.
Set up test and production environments, across regions and accounts.
Set up CI/CD pipelines to release your services to your environments.
Monitor and debug your services from your terminal.
init

Installation
To install with homebrew:

$ brew install aws/tap/copilot-cli

Instructions for installing Copilot for your platform
Getting started
Make sure you have the AWS command line tool installed and have already run aws configure before you start.

To get a sample app up and running in one command, run the following:

$ git clone git@github.com:aws-samples/aws-copilot-sample-service.git demo-app
$ cd demo-app
$ copilot init --app demo                \
  --name api                             \
  --type 'Load Balanced Web Service'     \
  --dockerfile './Dockerfile'            \
  --deploy
This will create a VPC, Application Load Balancer, an Amazon ECS Service with the sample app running on AWS Fargate. This process will take around 8 minutes to complete - at which point you'll get a URL for your sample app running! üöÄ
